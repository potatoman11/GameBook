      <p>God of War is an Action Adventure video game developed by Monica Studios, built for PlayStation 4. The gameplay is vastly different from previous installments. The previous main game, Ascension, introduced multiplayer to the series. One of the major differences is that Kratos doesn't use his double chained blades anymore (The Blades of Chaos), opting instead for a magical battle axe called the Leviathan Axe. God of War features continuous shot with no camera cuts. God of War also is similiar to many RPGs. Like previous games, there is a rage ability called Spartan Rage that gradually fills during combat. When full, it allows Kratos to use greatly damaging hand attacks. Chests and rare items also can be found throughout the game world. </p>

And last, the spells are Lightning Spell, Healing Spell, Rage Spell, Jump Spell, Freeze Spell, Clone Spell, Santa's Surprise, Poison Spell, Earthquake Spell, Haste Spell and Skeleton Spell. Hundreds of Thousands-if not millions of people play Clash worldwide and I have played this game myself and I love it. I do recommend this game, although it takes a long time to reach the higher town hall levels and can be frustrating. I personally give this game a 5 out of 5. </p>
